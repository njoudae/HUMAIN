HR Assistant â€“ Saudi Labor Law AI Companion
Overview:
A smart web assistant built to support users in understanding and interacting with Saudi labor law. The project combines a clean, intuitive interface with an AI model trained on official legal content.

What Makes It Unique:
Instead of manually coding the interface, I used GPT-4 to generate the full HTML/CSS design by uploading a screenshot of the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources website. GPT-4 produced a pixel-perfect replica in under 5 seconds, accelerating development time dramatically.
