# HUMAIN

In this portfolio, I showcase a series of projects built using GPT-4 not as a tool, but as a creative collaborator. My goal is to push the boundaries of what AI can generate — from full web interfaces to intelligent systems that understand and process real-world documents.

While leveraging GPT-4's speed and flexibility, I emphasize quality and accountability by:

- Carefully reviewing and modifying the generated code to ensure clean structure, performance, and accessibility.

- Designing context-rich prompts that guide the model clearly and consistently.

- In complex cases, I ask GPT-4 itself to help formulate the optimal prompt — by first describing the project idea and constraints, and then refining its own instructions iteratively.

This process enables rapid prototyping without compromising code quality, while exploring new human-AI workflows in development.

# Project 1
HR Assistant – Saudi Labor Law AI Companion
Overview:
A smart web assistant built to support users in understanding and interacting with Saudi labor law. The project combines a clean, intuitive interface with an AI model trained on official legal content.

What Makes It Unique:
Instead of manually coding the interface, I used GPT-4 to generate the full HTML/CSS design by uploading a screenshot of the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources website. GPT-4 produced a pixel-perfect replica in under 5 seconds, accelerating development time dramatically.

# Project 2

Child Drawing Analyzer – Visual AI Web Tool
Overview:
A web-based application designed to help analyze and interpret children’s drawings. The interface was fully generated using GPT-4 — from just a sketch of how the app should look — making it a collaborative product between human vision and AI execution.

What Makes It Unique:
Instead of coding the front-end manually, I uploaded a rough sketch of the UI and prompted GPT-4 to generate a full HTML/CSS/JavaScript layout. It delivered a working, clean interface in under 5 seconds.

# Project 3

Ask Me – Arabic Document Q&A Assistant
Overview:
"Ask Me" is an integrated Arabic-language web application that allows users to upload documents in various formats (PDF, Word, etc.) and ask questions about their content. The project relies entirely on GPT-4 to analyze texts and answer questions accurately and professionally.

What Makes It Unique:
Unlike typical chatbots, this tool intelligently extracts document content and reasons about it in Arabic using GPT-4. The entire system — UI + backend + prompt chain — was built with GPT-4 guidance.

# Project 5

Smart License Verifier – GPT-4 Document Intelligence System
Overview:
A dual-system web solution for analyzing Saudi driver’s licenses. The first system allows a user to upload or capture a license photo, while the second system (Admin Panel) receives structured data, validates fields, and enables edits if needed.

The entire system — including OCR, parsing, validation, and classification — is powered by GPT-4.
