# Project 1
HR Assistant – Saudi Labor Law AI Companion
Overview:
A smart web assistant built to support users in understanding and interacting with Saudi labor law. The project combines a clean, intuitive interface with an AI model trained on official legal content.

What Makes It Unique:
Instead of manually coding the interface, I used GPT-4 to generate the full HTML/CSS design by uploading a screenshot of the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources website. GPT-4 produced a pixel-perfect replica in under 5 seconds, accelerating development time dramatically.

# Project 2

Child Drawing Analyzer – Visual AI Web Tool
Overview:
A web-based application designed to help analyze and interpret children’s drawings. The interface was fully generated using GPT-4 — from just a sketch of how the app should look — making it a collaborative product between human vision and AI execution.

What Makes It Unique:
Instead of coding the front-end manually, I uploaded a rough sketch of the UI and prompted GPT-4 to generate a full HTML/CSS/JavaScript layout. It delivered a working, clean interface in under 5 seconds.

# Project 3

Ask Me – Arabic Document Q&A Assistant
Overview:
"Ask Me" is an integrated Arabic-language web application that allows users to upload documents in various formats (PDF, Word, etc.) and ask questions about their content. The project relies entirely on GPT-4 to analyze texts and answer questions accurately and professionally.

What Makes It Unique:
Unlike typical chatbots, this tool intelligently extracts document content and reasons about it in Arabic using GPT-4. The entire system — UI + backend + prompt chain — was built with GPT-4 guidance.
